                <p class="content-bot">By accepting our Privacy Policy and the applicable Terms of Service you consent
                    to our collection, storage, use and disclosure of your information as described in this Privacy

                <h2 class="c-content-title strong"><span>A.Types and Collection of Information</span></h2>
                <p class="content-bot">Our primary goal in collecting the information described below is to provide you,
                    the user, with a customized experience on our Service and to deliver better service, products, and
                    more relevant content to our customers, prospective customers, and visitors.</p>
                <h3 class="policy__title strong">1.Types of Information We Collect</h3>
                <p>We collect three basic types of information in connection with our Service: (a) Personal Information;
                    (b) Anonymous Information; and (c) Aggregated Information. Personal Information, Anonymous
                    Information and Aggregated Information as used in this Privacy Policy are defined below:</p>
                <p>“<span class="privacy-policy_strong__1SV8b">Personal Information</span>” means information that
                    identifies (whether directly or indirectly) a particular individual, such as the individual’s first
                    and last name, home or other physical address, email address, telephone number, wallet address.
                    Personal Information also includes identifiers, such as cookies, IP addresses and Mobile Device IDs
                    that recognize individuals over time and across different websites or online services, where those
                    identifiers can be reasonably linked to an identifiable individual.</p>
                <p>“<span class="privacy-policy_strong__1SV8b">Anonymous Information</span>” means information that does
                    not directly or indirectly identify, and cannot reasonably be used to identify, an individual
                    person. When Anonymous Information is directly or indirectly associated with or combined with any
                    Personal Information, such Anonymous Information will also be treated as Personal Information.</p>
                <p>“<span class="privacy-policy_strong__1SV8b">Aggregated Information</span>” means information about
                    groups or categories of persons, which does not identify and cannot reasonably be used to identify
                    an individual person.</p>
                <h3 class="policy__title strong">2.How We Collect Your Information</h3>

                <p><span class="privacy-policy_strong__1SV8b">Payment Information.</span> If your use of our Services
                    involves any purchase, we may collect the payment and billing information necessary to complete the

                    service provider and Personal Information disclosed in connection therewith will be subject to the
                    applicable privacy policies of such service provider. This Privacy Policy DOES NOT address the
                    collection and use of your Personal Information by such service providers. Moreover, the purchase of
                    third party credits or currencies such as Facebook Credits may also be subject to additional third
                    party privacy policies.</p>

                    <!-- -->When you communicate with us in connection with customer service and technical support, we

                    Service where you can post information about yourself and others and communicate with others or
                    upload content such as photographs. Such postings are governed by our applicable Terms of Service.
                    In addition, such postings may appear on other websites or services, or when searches are executed
                    on the subject of your posting. Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose Personal Information on
                    publicly-viewable areas, that information will be publicly available and can be collected and used
                    by others. For example, if you post your email address, you may receive unsolicited messages. We
                    cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information you
                    voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your
                    Personal Information.</p>

                    information an SNS is sharing with us, please go to the SNS where you access our Service to find out
                    more about their privacy settings.</p>

                    similar labels or captions clearly indicating the employment opportunity subject matter (the “Career
                    Pages”). We will collect employment-related information that you submit to us, including through

                    other sources, including, without limitation, other users of the Service and third party information

                    partners when you enter any promotions, sweepstakes and loyalty program. Such information may be
                    used to supplement your account information and/or profile and may be combined with other
                    information we collect from you.</p>
                <h4 class="policy__subtitle strong">Information Collected by Automated Technologies</h4>
                <p>When you interact with the Service, we collect Anonymous Information through automated technologies
                    as described below:</p>
                <p><span class="privacy-policy_strong__1SV8b">Cookies.</span> A “cookie” is a small text file that is
                    sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive or Mobile Device. We
                    may use cookies to track Anonymous Information about our users (e.g., user name, pages viewed, time
                    spent on our Site(s), games, and the sites visited just before and just after our Service) for
                    statistical and market research purposes.</p>
                <p>We use cookies to gather information about our users’ browser activities. We may also use local
                    shared objects also known as “flash cookies” to collect information from you.</p>
                <p>You have choices with respect to cookies. By modifying your browser preferences, you have the option
                    to reject all cookies, or limit the type of cookies you allow. Flash cookies operate differently
                    from browser cookies and cookie management tools available in a web browser will not remove flash
                    cookies. To learn more about and manage flash cookies please go to the following:<br /><a

                    Rejecting or limiting the type of cookies may, however, in limited instances prevent you from
                    accessing certain features on our Service.</p>
                <p><span class="privacy-policy_strong__1SV8b">Log Files.</span> Like most Internet services, we may also
                    use log files on the server side to collect information from you. Your information held in log files
                    includes your computer’s or Mobile Device’s IP (Internet Protocol) address, browser type, browser
                    language, e-mail application, Internet service provider, referring/exit Web pages, computer platform
                    type, date/time stamp, and user activity. The software enabling our Services has associated log and
                    temporary files that are stored on our servers. These files store your account information,
                    preference settings, system notifications as well as other data necessary to enable you to use our
                    Service. Your information may also be collected in connection with regularly performed server
                    backups.</p>
                <p><span class="privacy-policy_strong__1SV8b">Tracking Technologies.</span> We use a variety of tracking
                    methods to collect information from you, including, without limitation web beacons (also known as
                    Internet tags, pixel tags and clear GIFs). Web beacons are small pieces of data that are embedded in
                    images on the pages of websites to analyze the traffic patterns, such as the frequency users visit
                    various areas of our Services. Pixel tags may allow us to advertise more efficiently by excluding
                    our current users from certain promotional messages or identifying the source of a new installation.
                    These methods may involve collecting information directly from you or through another entity
                    authorized by us to collect information on our behalf. We also use these methods in HTML e-mails
                    that we send our guests to determine whether the recipients have opened those e-mails or clicked on
                    links in those e-mails. The information that we collect through tracking technologies is Anonymous
                    Information.</p>
                <p><span class="privacy-policy_strong__1SV8b">Third Party Advertisers.</span> Many advertisements are
                    managed and placed on the Service by third parties. These third party advertisers may use cookies,
                    web beacons or similar automated information collection technologies on your computer or Mobile
                    Devices to collect Anonymous Information from you. In some cases, we may have access to information
                    from cookies, web beacons and similar automated information collection technologies used by third
                    party advertisers on our Services and this information may permit us to identify other sites or
                    services that you have visited that are also associated with the third party advertiser.</p>
                <p>The use of cookies, web beacons, or similar automated information collection technologies by third
                    party advertisers is subject to their own privacy policies. Once you have clicked on an
                    advertisement and have left the Service, our Privacy Policy no longer applies and you must read the
                    privacy policy of the applicable third party advertiser to see how your information will be
                    collected, stored and used as part of their service. Specifically privacy choices you have made on
                    the third party site or platform will not apply to our use of the information we have collected
                    directly from you or through our automated technologies.</p>
                <p><span class="privacy-policy_strong__1SV8b">Click Through URLs.</span> Some of our Services, including
                    email messages, use “click-through URLs” linked to other content on our Services. We track this
                    click-through data to help us determine interest in topics and use of the Services.</p>
                <h2 class="c-content-title strong"><span>B.Use and Disclosure of Personal Information</span></h2>
                <p>Unless otherwise described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, we will not use or disclose any Personal
                    Information collected from you. Your Personal Information may be used alone or in the aggregate with

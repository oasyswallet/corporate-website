    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">We collect three basic types of information in connection with our Service: (a)

    </p>
    <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Personal Information&rdquo; means information that identifies (whether
            directly or indirectly) a particular individual, such as the individual&rsquo;s first and last name, home or

    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Anonymous Information&rdquo; means information that does not directly or
            indirectly identify, and cannot reasonably be used to identify, an individual person. When Anonymous
            Information is directly or indirectly associated with or combined with any Personal Information, such

            payment processing service provider and Personal Information disclosed in connection therewith will be
            subject to the applicable privacy policies of such service provider. This Privacy Policy DOES NOT address
            the collection and use of your Personal Information by such service providers. Moreover, the purchase of
            third party credits or currencies such as Facebook Credits may also be subject to additional third party
            privacy policies.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Customer Service and Technical Support. When you communicate with us in connection

    <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Profile Information. We provide areas on our Service where you can post information

            are governed by our applicable Terms of Service. In addition, such postings may appear on other websites or
            services, or when searches are executed on the subject of your posting. Also, whenever you voluntarily
            disclose Personal Information on publicly-viewable areas, that information will be publicly available and
            can be collected and used by others. For example, if you post your email address, you may receive
            unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the
            information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to
            your Personal Information.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Information Received from SNS and APIs. When you access an Application through an
            SNS, you allow us to access and obtain certain information from your profile through such SNS and the

            chat rooms, diaries, communities, blogs, web forums, message boards or other public forms in Applications

            disclose in such Forums is public information, and there is no expectation of privacy or confidentiality. If
            you access our Services from an SNS, you should also read that social network&rsquo;s terms of service and
            privacy policy. If you are unclear about what information an SNS is sharing with us, please go to the SNS
            where you access our Service to find out more about their privacy settings.</span></p>
